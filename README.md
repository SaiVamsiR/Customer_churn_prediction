# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts **customer churn** using **logistic regression**. Churn prediction helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them. 💡

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer details such as:
- 🏷 **Demographics** (age, gender, location)
- 📜 **Account Details** (tenure, subscription plan) 
- 📈 **Usage Behavior** (monthly charges, total spend)
- 🆘 **Customer Support** (complaints, resolution time)

## 🛠 Dependencies
To get started, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🎯 Model Training
The logistic regression model follows these key steps:
1. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. 🔍 **Feature Selection** – Identifying the most relevant variables.
3. 🤖 **Model Training** – Using logistic regression to classify churn likelihood.
4. 📏 **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results
The model provides predictions and insights into churn factors, including:
- ✅ **Confusion Matrix**
- 📊 **ROC Curve**
- 📌 **Feature Importance Analysis**

## 🔮 Future Improvements
Enhancements to explore:
- 🛠 **Hyperparameter tuning** for better accuracy
- 🏆 **Alternative classification models**
- 🔄 **Real-time customer monitoring**
